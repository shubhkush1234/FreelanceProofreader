<h3>Introduction to freelancing on Upwork: </h3>

What is upwork?

Its a kind of dating site for professionals. So it brings together clients and freelancers into a business repationship. 

Why join Upwork?
    Side income for paying debts.

Challenges faced by the beginner:

1. less number of jobs in the starting.
2. no ratings, so very less clients trust you.
3. Very tedious work at the beginning
4. strive for good rating

What you have to do?
1. Have patience
2. Apply for everything

In the beginning, the focus should be on getting good ratings, maybe you need to do a lot of creepy jobs for that!

Make good clients, they are cool!!

<h3> Types of account in Upwork </h3>

1. freelance account (free of cost)
    It gives you connects (points) for bidding.
    That means you can't make unlimited biddings, can't spam the bidder. (2 connects/bid)
2. agency account 
    It is another type of account. It's fees is 20 USD/month.
    It gives more connects (80 connects, i.e 40 bids per month).
    You can win contracts and subcontract the jobs you win to those people and pay them whatwver you negotiate with them.
3. client account // only when you are working

But as a begginner, I suggest you to work through freee account.

<h3> Getting Paid </h3>
    
Eg. Prefer payment verified and fixed budget projects. They are prepaid to upwork and payment is released after the work is completeed. Read client history also.

Also, look for number of praposals and how many he's interviewing. If the <b>number of praposals</b> are less and he's interviewing 0 to 3 people, your chances for getting hired is higher.

Also, look for required <b>Connects</b> to submit praposal. Usually it is 2.

Read job details carefully. Bid for slightly less than the client budget. We'll talk about this later. For free freelance account, the bid range is not visible. Agency account is needed for that. Upwork's fee amount is deducted from the bid amount you praposed, it's written there.

Estimated duration you can choose minimum as you don't want to loose bid due to this. Anyways, we'll be discussing with client about the duration.

And after that here comes the cover letter. Cover letter is the first point of contact with the client. Stck to 3 4 formats and edit the same every time.

# Bidding Principles to Win #

Connects = Cost of doing business
look for time sensitive jobs = look for Upwork multiple times a day. These jobs can be really good paying jobs. They can be dangerous also because you have to maybe rush things a bit. 

Is it 400 pages in 24 hours? No way.

But if somebody wants a really short admission essay edited, go ahead and do it.

You may fail for most of the bids. Be ready for that.

Bidding success rate is 10% approx.
Don't ignore small value jobs. It doesn't take long and are a bit easier. 

My philosophy is to bid for everything and bid and forget, and move on. Just constantly bid on things.

Price can win the bid!!

Price can beat experience. Most people underbid and win the job.


# How much you should bid? #

How much you need?

How much time you can give?

It depends on the cost of living of you society.

Don't bid too much.

Also depends on the size of project.

Length = time = money

Bid slightly lower than the average, maybe 10% lower.

Doesn't undermine the marketplace:

Big budget jobs:
Maybe the work is too tedious, so don't go for it if you have limited amount of time.

# The power of good ratings #

Rating > Income

Do small jobs and earn good ratings. Thats the formula to get more number of clients!!

So, as you keep getting good ratings, raise your price as well. But your ratings should be worth enough.

Ask happy clients for good review. Not all clients give reviews.


Good reviews = high rates and more jobs

# Develop a stable of repeat clients #

If client review is good, they will give more work. Repeat clients gives more business. 50% of income now the author is getting from the repeat clients.

After that, try to take the work offline. It saves the upwork service fee. Upwork takes 20% of amount as fees.

# Editing and Proofreading Approaches and Philosophies #

1. Client Expectation

What does the client mean by editing or proofreading?

Definitions:
Proofreading is considered as a final check of a document for typos, spelling, layout problems etc.

- No rewriting
- No moving paragraphs around.
- No changing order.

Bas writing - Reconsider.

What is editing?

1. Sentence level 
2. Substantive/ Structural

It includes:

1. Grammer and styles
2. Rewriting
3. Correcting spelling typos, punctualtions 
4. Capitalization + Heading styles + Bold usage


Proofreading pays you the least, than Sentence-level, and the highly paying is the Substantive editing.

Strategy:

1. Look for Grammer, style and punctuation
2. Capitalization, bold, indentation


# One Editing philosophy that keeps client happy #

One editing style that helped me the most is:

1. Not to change the core of their idea.
2. Recasting sentences is okay.
3. Don't change everything for no reason.

Consider proofreading and editing as weeding the garden. You just need to remove the weeds crowing out the beautiful flowers and bushes.

4. Find goodness, make it better.
5. Remove wordiness, passive voice etc.
6. Ideas, info and stories remains intact.

Always remember, More time, More jobs, More money.

# Tips to succeed as an editor and proofreader #

1. Create error page:
    In that document, you write down some of the most common errors that you're starting ro see as you go through. 

Eg:
```js
    out = our
    god = God
    Ariana or Arianna?
    Chief or chief?
    stop = spot
    gray or grey?
    suite = suit
```

Client Profile:
1. Common errors

The author usually creates a client profile. the next time I get another document from the client, he looks for that errors first.

2. Track changes
    It is a feature present in MS Word.
